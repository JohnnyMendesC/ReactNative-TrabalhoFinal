To call the API using a city name instead of latitude and longitude coordinates, you can use the Geocoding API to convert the city name to its geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). Once you have the coordinates, you can then use them to make your API call. Here's a step-by-step process:

First, use the Geocoding API to convert the city name to coordinates:

https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q={city name}&limit=1&appid={API key}
Replace
{city name}
with the name of your city and
{API key}
with your unique API key.

The Geocoding API response will include the latitude (
lat
) and longitude (
lon
) of the city. Extract these values from the response.

Use the obtained latitude and longitude in your API call. For example, if you're using the Current Weather Data API, the call would look like this:

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}
Replace
{lat}
and
{lon}
with the latitude and longitude values obtained from the Geocoding API, and
{API key}
with your unique API key.

Please note that built-in geocoder functionality has been deprecated in some APIs, and it's recommended to use the Geocoding API for converting city names to coordinates and vice versa.

To extract latitude and longitude from a response using Axios 
in React Native, you typically make a request to an API that 
returns location data, including latitude and longitude. Assuming 
you're making a request to an API that returns location data 
in JSON format, you can extract latitude and longitude from 
the Axios response like this:

First, ensure you have Axios installed in your React Native 
project. If not, you can install it by running:

npm install axios

Then, you can use Axios to make a request to the API, and in the

.then

callback function, you can access the latitude and longitude 
from the response data. Here's a basic example:

import axios from 'axios';
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Replace 'Your_API_Endpoint' with the actual endpoint you're calling
    axios.get('Your_API_Endpoint')
      .then(response => {
        // Assuming the API response structure includes an object with latitude and longitude
        const latitude = response.data.latitude;
        const longitude = response.data.longitude;

        console.log(`Latitude: ${latitude}, Longitude: ${longitude}`);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log('Error fetching data: ', error);
      });
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Check your console for latitude and longitude</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;


In this example, replace
'Your_API_Endpoint'
with the actual endpoint URL you're using to fetch the location data. The

response.data

is where you typically find the data returned by the API, and you can access 
the latitude and longitude properties based on the structure of the data 
returned by your specific API.

Please note, the exact path to access latitude and longitude in

response.data

may vary depending on the API you're using. You might need to adjust

response.data.latitude
and
response.data.longitude

to match the structure of your API response.

If the API response structure is more complex, you may need to navigate
through nested objects or arrays to find the latitude and values. You 
can log

response.data

to the console to inspect the structure of the response and determine 
the correct path to access the desired data.


///////////
Based on the logs you've provided, it appears that the
response
and
response.data
are JavaScript objects, which is why when you attempt to log them directly to the console using template literals, they are displayed as
[object Object]
. This is the default string representation of an object in JavaScript. To view the contents of these objects, you should use
console.log
directly on the object without converting it to a string, or use
JSON.stringify
to convert the object to a readable string format.

Regarding the
latitude
and
longitude
being
undefined
, it suggests that these variables are not being correctly assigned values before they are logged. This could be due to several reasons, such as not properly extracting these values from the
response
object or these values not being present in the
response
object at all.

To debug this, you can:

Log the entire
response
object directly to see its structure and verify if it contains the latitude and longitude data:

console.log('Response:', response);
Use
JSON.stringify
to convert the
response
and
response.data
objects into a readable string format that can be logged:

console.log(`Response: ${JSON.stringify(response, null, 2)}`);
console.log(`Data: ${JSON.stringify(response.data, null, 2)}`);
Ensure that you are correctly accessing the latitude and longitude properties from the
response
object. This step depends on the structure of your
response
object, which you can identify from step 1. For example, if the
response
object has a
data
property that contains the latitude and longitude, you might access them like so:

const latitude = response.data.latitude;
const longitude = response.data.longitude;
console.log(`Latitude: ${latitude}, Longitude: ${longitude}`);
If
latitude
and
longitude
are still
undefined
, you'll need to verify that the API call is successful and that the response structure matches your expectations based on the API's documentation.
